<p>I’m an Electrical Engineer by training. Like many, I didn’t practice in my core field and have covered a variety of disciplines for companies large and small having worked in and travelled to over 30 countries.</p>

<p>I actively code as a hobby, but my expertise is primarily in a TMT and SaaS Product &amp; full stack Business Operations in both a corporate enterprise and startup capacity.</p>

<p>My career started out in the telco space, gaining experience working from both the vendor and operator perspectives - with a lot of field engineering thrown in at the start. From there, I branched out to run my own startups, initially an ASP and then a mobile app company, both in the UK.</p>

<p>On my return to Canada, I took a position working for Clio, a Bessemer backed SaaS legal tech company as their director of International Expansion - which frequently brought me back to Europe several times, but this time I was domiciled where I was born. Since then I’ve been consulting with companies in a product and business operations capacity from an international perspective.</p>

<p>I’m heavily biased towards modern SaaS tools and help in both selection, configuration and creating the processes to get the most of technology choices.</p>

<p>In previous roles, depending on the size of the organization I can be a COO, to a business operations specialist or general manager.  Those terms best encapsulate the hats I wear in a given role:</p>

<p>-Product Management (Working with, engaging and adapting products for international markets). With regards to International marketing print initiatives, I love explaining the A-Series of paper formats.
-International Expansion - Greenfield operations for companies seeking to expand, taking into account legal, tax, regulatory, business development and marketing aspects. I work with governmental inward investment teams and academic institutions to help companies take advantage of in country resources effectively.
-International Business Development - Closely tied with the above, but specifically about driving new business and engagement models from strategy and partnership programs, to internationally tailored marketing outreach.
-Program (Programme for you UK folks) and Project Management
-Business Operations - Typically for smaller companies, helping you start your business properly - from HR and accounting to overall governance.  I pride myself on using best of breed SaaS tools.</p>

<p>An executive that has solid experience across many disciplines can manage multidisciplinary teams more effectively.</p>

<p>My latest hobby project is TailorCV.com - a free service to help you build custom CV’s and track your achievements over time. I built this to scratch my own itch as much as anything.</p>
