			<h2>Latest From the Blog</h2>
	    		<h4><a href="https://nagibtharani.com/blog/moving_over_to_hugo_for_my_blog/">Moving over to Hugo</a></h4>
					<p>I&rsquo;ve had several false starts on blogging over the years. I usually get caught up in blogging for companies.
This year I made a commitment to blog for myself and be more active in branding myself online. I&rsquo;ve chosen Hugo as the platform.
This will be the first in 3 part series on why I chose Hugo, and how to setup Hugo and in future, a retrospective on how Hugo is working out.</p>

			<main class="">

			<h2 id="services">Services</h2>
			<p> I've worn a variety of hats and am deeply conversant with all business functions.</p>
			<div class="hst_flex_item">
			<div>
				<div class="hst_flex_row_item_content">
					<h2>International Expansion</h2>
					<p>Global expansion tailored for your business. Whether B2C, B2B or Enterprise. I have worked with inward investment teams at IDA Ireland, UKTi, Invest-HK, DFAIT &amp; AusTrade. I leverage local government resources where appropriate. This really is a catch all and leverages everything over my career. I'm the guy you send into a field, far, far, away who can wear many hats and kick start your operations. I did a lot of telecoms/data field engineering spanning over 30 countries early in my career. </p>		
					
				</div>
			</div>

			<div>
				<div class="hst_flex_row_item_content">
					<h2>Business Development</h2>
					<p>Greenfield Sales and setup of Channel &amp; Strategic Partnerships where no playbook or template exists. Where repeatable, I create the process before handover to a sales/AE/SDR team. I started out as the director of International Business Development at Clio, but International Expansion better reflected my remit. Early on, as a pre-sales engineer, business upsell is always close to your heart.</p>
					
				</div>
			</div>

			<div>
				<div class="hst_flex_row_item_content">
					<h2>Business Operations</h2>
					<p>Company infrastructure &amp; governance for both greenfield startups to international subsidiaries. Where appropriate I engage specialist tax, legal and regulatory help. I write your v1.0 executive and employee handbooks: From hiring and departmental logistics and tooling, management reporting, CRM, bookkeeping, support and everything along the way. On the staff side, I provide guidance covering expense policies, vacation, culture and benefits. I am heavily biased towards SaaS based tools.</p>
					
				</div>
			</div>

			<div>
				<div class="hst_flex_row_item_content">
					<h2>Product Management</h2>
					<p>From startup (primary), through venture backed companies in a product ownership role. At larger companies, I typically handle international product requirements as they apply to a given market. Having studied as an engineer, I work well with developers. Being left handed, if the stereotype holds, means I appreciate art and design more. And that informs my appreciation of UX and UI.</p>		
					
				</div>
			</div>

			<div>
				<div class="hst_flex_row_item_content">
					<h2>Marketing Operations</h2>
					<p>From acting as a spoke to an existing marketing operation to adapting their capabilities for international markets and helping to streamline content operations for print and web. I particularly enjoy acquainting marketing teams with the wonders of the A series of paper formats. Fluent in all aspects of demand generation. Did you check the UTM source tag in the URL that possibly brought you here?</p>
					
				</div>
			</div>

			<div>
				<div class="hst_flex_row_item_content">
					<h2>Program Management</h2>
					<p>$MM P&amp;L Responsibility. Primairily in TMT from both the vendor and operator perspectives. Because I can code I handle both Technical Program Management ("TPM") and non TPM roles and can fully appreciate engineering impact as it applies to program scheduling. As to getting stuff done, I don't care for MS Project, other than to create a gantt chart for proposals. I love Asana and their perspective on <a href="https://blog.asana.com/2015/06/why-one-assignee/">ownership</a></p>
					
				</div>
			</div>


			<div>
				<div class="hst_flex_row_item_content">
					<h2>Sales Engineering</h2>
					<p>Also called Solutions Engineering. Or Pre-Sales Engineering. In either case I sit comfortably with all parties to demonstrate, support, inspire and on-board prospects or customers. My career started out in telecomunications engineering as an SME.</p>
					
				</div>
			</div>


			<div>
				<div class="hst_flex_row_item_content">
					<h2>Development</h2>
					<p>This isn't my primary skill, but more a hobby that I apply to my own projects. A key advantage it affords me is a deep understanding of industry software and integration potential which is useful when I'm engaged in a product management or pre-sales capacity. I'm competent in Javascript, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3 and appreciate the importance of good design. </p>
					
				</div>
			</div>

			<div>
				<div class="hst_flex_row_item_content">
					<h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
					<p>I founded startups, worked in venture backed ones, and acted in a corporate intrapreneurship capacity at larger companies. My passion is in the 
					"Prosumer" segment, or the consumeration of IT. In English: well designed easy to use software that is a delight for people to use and builds a community.</p>
