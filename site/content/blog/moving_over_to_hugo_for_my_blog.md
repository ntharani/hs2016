I've had several false starts on blogging over the years. I usually get caught up in blogging for companies. 

This year I made a commitment to blog for myself and be more active in branding myself online. I've chosen Hugo as the platform. 

This will be the first in 3 part series on why I chose Hugo, and how to setup Hugo and in future, a retrospective on how Hugo is working out.
