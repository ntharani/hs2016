Hi,

I’d love to apply for the junior PM role.

My background is in engineering, but my career has largely been in business development. I’ve always been involved in product discussions and have often been engaged in gathering product insights and feedback from customers.

I’m now looking to do product management in a formal capacity and would love to take on this challenge at vision critical.

If you’re interested, I can be reached at 778.926.7102 or me@nagibtharani.com

Thank you,

Nagib
